Enter your current tire's parameters (ie: 205/60-16) you will see a list of tires sorted based on similarity.

Adding a tire to your favorites will tell you:
 • the difference it would cause in your speedometer and odometer reading
 • difference in clearance
 • overall tire diameter
 • tire wall height

When you are done you can share your favorite list by email with yourself or your mechanic.
